Join your friends and deploy your own Trivia Bot for your Discord server!

The user can now run the "trivia" command to launch your own trivia game with friends!

The bot will print a personal welcome message with instructions, a question, amd 4 multiple choice answers. After typing an answer, the user can then be notified if the answer to the prompted question is correct or incorrect through evaluation.

The Trivia Bot will post a "Great Job!" or "Better Luck Next Time!" in the Discord server to indicate whether the user's answer was correct/incorrect. It will also allow users to enter the answer in uppercase or lowercase, and it will still work!
